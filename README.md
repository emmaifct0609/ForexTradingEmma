This project's objective is to create a web application through which the 2018 FOREX trading values for a group of currencies can be checked. The data is presented both separated by months and in a single annual chart. In all charts, the highest, lowest, opening and closing values will be shown. The currency exchanges whose values will be available are:

- Australian dollar/Japanese yen
- Pound sterling/American dollar
- Euro/Canadian dollar
- Euro/American dollar
- American dollar/Swiss franc
- American dollar/Japanese yen
- Australian dollar/American dollar

The project is being developed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
